                        <p className="m-2 text-gray-500 ml-5">We value our customerâ€™s time and hence moved away from a single customer care number to a comprehensive chat-based support system for quick and easy resolution. You no longer have to go through the maze of an IVRS call support. Just search for your issue in the help section on this page and initiate a chat with us. A customer care executive will be assigned to you shortly. You can also email us your issue on <b>support@swiggy.in</b> <br/><br/>Note: We value your privacy and your information is safe with us. Please do not reveal any personal information, bank account number, OTP etc. to another person. A Swiggy representative will never ask you for these details. Please do not reveal these details to fraudsters and imposters claiming to be calling on our behalf. Be vigilant and do not entertain phishing calls or emails.</p>
